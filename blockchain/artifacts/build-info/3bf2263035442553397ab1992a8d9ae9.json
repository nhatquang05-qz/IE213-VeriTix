WARNING: Note that the caller is responsible to confirm that the recipient is capable of receiving ERC-721 or else they may be permanently lost. Usage of {safeTransferFrom} prevents loss, though the caller must understand this adds an external call which potentially creates a reentrancy vulnerability. Requirements: - `from` cannot be the zero address. - `to` cannot be the zero address. - `tokenId` token must be owned by `from`. - If the caller is not `from`, it must be approved to move this token by either {approve} or {setApprovalForAll}. Emits a {Transfer} event.\"},\"transferOwnership(address)\":{\"details\":\"Transfers ownership of the contract to a new account (`newOwner`).
